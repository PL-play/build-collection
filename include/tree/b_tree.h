/**
 * B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data
 * and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
 * time. The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more
 * than two children. Unlike other self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree
 * is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks
 * of data, such as databases and file systems.
 *
 * According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order m is a tree which satisfies
 * the following properties:
 *  1. Every node has at most m children.
 *  2. Every internal node has at least ⌈m/2⌉ children.
 *  3. The root node has at least two children unless it is a leaf.
 *  4. All leaves appear on the same level.
 *  5. A non-leaf node with k children contains k−1 keys.
 *
 *  Each internal node's keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees.
 *
